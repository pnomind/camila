<p>Dear Sir or Madam, My name is Jun Zhao, a customer. My Fidaty number is 0400171680436.

 I have purchased one airports pro from your store yesterday, the order number is . Once I arrived home, I checked the serial number of the product on the Apple website, while it suggested that the product expected coverage expiration date is 28/11/2021 instead of 1 year from now. 

Then I contacted Apple and they told me that the product was activated on 29/11/2020, which suggests the product might have been used or other potential issues. 

This confuses and angers me as Esselunga is one of the best retailers in Italy and the one that I trust the most. Personally, I wouldn’t believe it is possible for Esselunga to sell a questionable second hand product. But how come a newly purchased device was activated almost 5 months ago? 

I had so much great experience shopping in Esselunga in the past, hence I would believe that you guys would give me satisfied feedback. Attached is the copy of the purchase receipt as well as the Applecare web screen shoot. 


With regard,
Jun Zhao</p>
